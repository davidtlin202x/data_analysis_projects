Intro: 

It's a well known phenomenon that as fertility rates decrease, GDP generally increases.  Here, the goal is to identify patterns and correlations between economic development and fertility trends.  Here, we isolated the data for one year (2023) and used it to plot the data.  GDP data is plotted logarithmically, while Fertility data is plotted linearly.

Data Files:
- fertility-rate.csv
- gdp-per-capita.csv

Tools: 
- Pandas – Data manipulation and merging
- Seaborn – Data visualization (scatter plots, regression lines)
- Matplotlib – Plotting and customization
- scikit-learn – Linear regression modeling (although in theory you don't need this)
